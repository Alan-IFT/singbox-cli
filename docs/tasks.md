# Task Board — singbox-cli

> Maintained by **PM Orchestrator**. Each task appears here when started and is updated through its lifecycle.
>
> New tasks should check this board for related historical work before planning.

## Active tasks

| ID | Slug | Stage | Started | Doc folder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(none)_ | | | | |

## Completed tasks

| ID | Slug | Outcome | Completed | Doc folder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | install-enable-start-split | **DELIVERED** — installer now reports its true outcome (unconditional autostart registration, real cause logged to `/var/log/sing-box/install.log`, honest banner, non-zero exit on failure). Absorbed the former T-04. `verify_all PASS: 16 / WARN: 0 / FAIL: 0`. AC-9 unverified (no restricted-network VM) → T-07. Uncommitted; stream owns delivery. | 2026-07-31 | `docs/features/install-enable-start-split/` (mode: full) |

## Conventions

- **ID** is sequential: `T-001`, `T-002`, ...
- **Slug** is lowercase-kebab, ≤40 chars (e.g. `csv-export-orders`).
- **Stage** is one of: `req`, `design`, `gate`, `dev`, `review`, `test`, `delivery`, `blocked`, `done`.
- **Doc folder** is the relative path under `docs/features/<slug>/`.

## How tasks relate

When starting a new task, the Requirement Analyst scans this board for related work:

- Same module → read prior `02_SOLUTION_DESIGN.md` first.
- Same feature → build on prior design, don't redesign.
- Conflicting decisions → flag for user.
