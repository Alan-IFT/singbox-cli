# Why: .harness/ is the source of truth; CLAUDE.md + .github/copilot-instructions.md
# are generated. Claude Code keeps them fresh via a Stop hook in .claude/settings.json,
# but that Stop hook is Claude-Code-specific — it does NOT fire for GitHub Copilot,
# Cursor, or hand-edits. This pre-commit hook is the tool-agnostic backstop: any
# commit that includes stale generated artifacts is blocked, regardless of who or
# what edited .harness/.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .harness/scripts/install-hooks.sh
#
# To disable: rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
